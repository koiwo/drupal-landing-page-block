Making a Drupal block to work like a little landing page with fade out on first visit
========================

Requirements:

1. fullscreen content

2. fade out automatically

3. session cookie to prevent unlimited display

Maybe it's a stupid idea and I should build a classic landing page with redirect instead. But I'ld like to try that block approach first and see how far I can go with it.
